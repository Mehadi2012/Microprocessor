Multiplication:

1. when we are multiplying two 8 bits number, then we need to store one 8 bits number in AL and the other 8 bits number coulbe be stored in a variable or any source(ah,bl,bh etc). The result 
   will be stored in AX

2. when we are multiplying two 16 bits(word) number, then we need to store one 16 bits number in AX and the other 16 bits number coulbe be stored in a variable or any source(ah,bl,bh etc). The result
   will be 32 bits and will be stored in Two different registers(AX,DX). MSB 16 bits will be stored in DX and the other 16 in AX.


3. Define Variables:
      var db 300      [Here 'var' is the varible name, 'db' is the byte(d=data,b=byte type and 300 is the value]
      a dw 200        [Here 'a' is the varible name, 'dw' is the word(d=data,b=word type and 200 is the value] 



Division:

1. when we are dividing in byte form, then we need to store divident 16 bits number in AX and the divisor 8 bits number coulbe be stored in a variable or any source(ah,bl,bh etc). The 8 bits
   quotient will be stored in AL and the 8 bits remainder is in AH.

2. when we are dividing in word form, then we need to store divident 32 bits number in DX:AX and the divisor 16 bits number coulbe be stored in a variable or any source(ah,bl,bh etc). The 816 bits
   quotient will be stored in AX and the 16 bits remainder is in DX.
